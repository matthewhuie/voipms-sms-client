    <!-- Phone numbers -->
    <string name="preferences_dids_info">The phone numbers you wish to use with this app must have SMS enabled. Otherwise, they will not appear in this list. Use the VoIP.ms &lt;a href="https://voip.ms/m/managedid.php"&gt;phone number configuration menu&lt;/a&gt; to enable SMS for your phone numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This app uses the SMS URL callback feature for push notifications and attempts to configure it automatically.
